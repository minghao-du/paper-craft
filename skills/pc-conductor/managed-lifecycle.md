# Managed Run lifecycle

Use the core Run-driver operations as transition authority. Only the owning Orchestrator requests top-level stages with `dispatchStage`; the runtime verifies Run authority, fixed provider, immutable input revision and accepted prerequisites before reserving and launching through the managed adapter. Domain acceptance remains the EPIC or specialist's judgment, represented by the workflow's current-fact verifier. A role's recommendation is not a dispatch.

A Dispatch records Run, subject, role, stage, provider, input revision, immutable Brief reference and generation. Repeating identical inputs returns the same Dispatch. Changed inputs create a new generation only after prior occupancy is resolved. Retry with `retryStage` only after independently verified termination; each retry retains prior Attempts and creates a fresh Attempt identity. Unknown occupancy remains reserved.

Publish a result with `publishStageReceipt`: include all correlation fields, outcome and hashed evidence references. Publication writes an immutable Receipt before the durable reported event; a wakeup may follow publication but never substitutes for it. Correct a rejected claim with a new Receipt pointing to `corrects`; never edit prior evidence. Notifications may be lost, so inspect the registry for reported results.

Use `acceptStageReceipt` with current external facts and ownership evidence. Runtime checks identity, latest Attempt, provider, current input revision, evidence hashes and supersession, then records an independent acknowledgement. Reported, rejected and accepted are distinct. A completed claim alone cannot advance dependent work. The next dispatch requires accepted prerequisites; unrelated stages need not wait. Fact verification runs outside the registry lock and revision checking rejects a concurrent update before acceptance.

Inspect `pc workflow orchestrator status --config <authoritative-config>` for the registry, including Dispatch lifecycle, process state, immutable claims and acceptance evidence. Dashboard projects the same records read-only. A process exit or timeout never proves business acceptance or checkout release. Legacy records without correlation remain unknown.

On reconnect, `startRun` reconciles persisted startup identity, immutable Receipt files, reported events and accepted acknowledgements. `pc workflow orchestrator recover <run> --config <config>` provides the same recovery explicitly. Inspect `reconciliation` for blockers and accepted Dispatches awaiting scheduling; request the next stage with its original immutable inputs so replay has one effect. Recovery does not fabricate domain acceptance or infer termination from elapsed time. Missing acknowledgement may be recovered only through the selected provider's evidence channel.

Use `--replace` only when the provider independently verifies the prior Orchestrator stopped. Runtime reserves the replacement and changes mutation authority before launch, retaining the prior identity. Unknown occupancy stays blocked. Stage retries use the same termination requirement. Set repair limits through `setRemediationLimit`; rejected claims persist consecutive counts and actionable feedback. Exhaustion blocks that Dispatch, not unrelated work. Acceptance clears its consecutive count. Neither replaying rejected claims nor restarting resets the budget.

## Concurrent Run ownership

Use the Run-qualified Orchestrator identity and driver lock, never the legacy Fleet-wide conductor for a new Run. `dispatchStage` reserves the repository/Issue owner and physically canonical configured checkout before launch. A conflicting subject must use `referenceRunSubject` to record the consuming Run; that reference does not authorize another Worker. Distinct Fleets use the same atomic `.pc-execution-owner` marker in the physical checkout, so aliases cannot conceal another owner. Unknown or malformed ownership remains occupied.

Inspect `subjects` and `resources` in the authoritative registry/read-only projection. Only `releaseRunCheckout` may release a checkout after independently verified termination of its recorded executions; completed output or an elapsed timeout is not termination. Failed launch reservations stay held for reconciliation. The marker can precede registry publication after an interrupted write; preserve it until ownership is independently reconciled rather than deleting it to retry.

Select `codex`, `agy`, or `claude` with `pc workflow orchestrator start <issue> --provider <provider> --config <config>`. Each Run retains that provider for its Orchestrator and every stage; a conflicting reconnect fails without replacement. Recovery selects the persisted provider. Installed CLI capability probes run before reservation/dispatch and never fall back to another provider. Codex requires JSON events and resume; agy and Claude require print/stream-JSON, additional writing roots and their explicit conversation/resume flag. Their startup evidence requires a provider session identity and an assistant event; collection requires successful exit and a successful result event. Missing or unfamiliar protocol evidence stays unknown. Actual tmux window/pane identities supplement provider acknowledgement and never replace it. Inspect errors on the persisted Attempt and Run reconciliation before retrying.

## Child-only intake and overlapping Runs

A child request authorizes only that Issue. Read native open dependencies and retain parent context; unresolved metadata or open blockers stops dispatch, without starting siblings or closing the parent. The compatible `conductor issue` entry and `driveEpicIssue` use this scoped delivery path.

Before allocating each EPIC child, reference its repository/Issue subject in the Fleet registry. Existing ownership wins in either intake order. A child request against EPIC-owned work reconnects to that owner; resume the owning Run rather than dispatching another child driver. Provider conflict blocks reconnect and never switches the active provider. An EPIC consuming standalone delivery must obtain its own explicit professional acceptance against its objective and scoped brief before counting that result. Pending or rejected referenced delivery blocks that dependency, without inheriting parent-finalization authorization.

## Current-head PR merge

Use the existing PR driver for automatic landing. It binds the quality result and EPIC professional confirmation to the live head, checks required GitHub results again, and uses expected-head compare-and-merge. Managed Runs reserve the checkout and record quality Dispatch/Attempt/Receipt acceptance before the driver requests merge. A moved head or failed gate requires current evidence rather than inheriting approval. Repository and closing-Issue attribution must match the delivery.

Inspect `pullRequests` alongside dispatches in the read-only registry projection. A lost merge response is reconciled against GitHub before another request; preserve the actual merge commit and evaluated head. `merged` is pending delivery: Worker final records, preservation and cleanup still follow through the existing completion driver. An unknown merge result or missing version is uncertainty to preserve, never evidence that cleanup is safe.

## Post-merge delivery

Resume through `finishDelivery`/`landDelivery` after verified merge. Worker final records are a distinct `final-records` Dispatch: include assessment, final worklog, follow-up attribution (an explicit empty list when none), and execution-release evidence. Independently verify prior and Worker termination before accepting records and dispatching `preservation-cleanup` to PR-Land. Unknown occupancy retains the checkout and leaves delivery pending.

PR-Land uses the existing verified archive and Git bundle checks before cleanup. The driver verifies all execution termination, retains checkout ownership through verified bundle validation and worktree removal, then releases the reservation and accepts cleanup. Inspect `deliveries` for records, archive, cleanup, and delivered status; the associated immutable stage Receipts retain evidence after removal. Issue closure and Issue-Run completion follow verified cleanup. An EPIC Run remains active for its own acceptance/finalization. Resume retained completion state after failure; never rerun a verified merge or discard accepted records to retry cleanup.

EPIC closure binds professional acceptance and explicit human confirmation to the delivery fingerprint (accepted integrated head, attributed changes, and completed child records). Recheck that fingerprint immediately before closure. Child-only Runs cannot initiate parent closure. Only verified EPIC closure opens `post_closure_finalization`; it does not complete the Run. Pipeline and Research-State operate after closure, retain accepted delivery versions separately from later observations, and preserve specialist occupancy and retry guards.

Managed EPIC completion requires a verified report after accepted Pipeline disposition.
The destination reservation spans Fleets and physical aliases. The report writer receives
only its candidate writing directory; failed validation retains the prior publication.
Registry report identity includes path, hash, revision, accepted and observed versions;
only successful publication completes the Run. Unknown writer ownership blocks reuse.
