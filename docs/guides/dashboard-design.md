# Dashboard design

MVP decisions recorded and synthesized into the companion specification at the user's request. The external architecture proposal is input, not an accepted specification. Implementation remains deferred, including after design agreement and specification publication.

## Agreed scope

- Preserve broad useful observation coverage with minimal depth in the first release, rather than limiting it to an intervention inbox.
- Serve a single person initially, with local access and SSH tunneling for remote access; shared multi-user access is outside the initial scope.
- A read-only dashboard may be a complete delivery. Control actions are a possible later direction, not a committed milestone; do not require their infrastructure in the initial design.
- Initial features include overview and intervention items; Conductor, EPIC and Worker lists/details including tasks without an EPIC; checkout/Git/collision/hold evidence; terminal/runner/process evidence and collection diagnostics; GitHub Issue/PR/CI/review information; worklogs, search/filtering and changes observed after recording begins.
- Aggregate multiple Fleets without changing the existing one-EPIC-agent-per-Conductor relationship. Preserve Project's existing meaning as a research project grouping related repositories.
- Existing records may not distinguish execution attempts. Display this uncertainty; do not require new Worker identity records or reconstruct unsupported execution history. Collector observations are not execution identities.
- Include configured remote hosts and explicitly associated compute tasks. Do not discover task ownership by scanning arbitrary remote processes.
- Register Fleets explicitly by authoritative configuration path and remember them. Project association is optional; retain invalid registrations with actionable diagnostics.
- Persist meaningful observed changes, not every full snapshot, in pc's own local data directory with a default retention of 30 days. Record observation gaps; do not claim complete recovery of changes during downtime.
- Default log content is the worklog. Offer bounded, on-demand terminal output and existing Runner logs with segmented loading, manual refresh and copying. Show source and read time; report read failures. Do not continuously archive all terminal output or accept terminal input.
- Generate intervention items from explicit records or deterministic rules, with supporting evidence. An open PR alone is not a request for user approval. Staleness can request investigation but cannot prove exit or availability. Show unknown/conflicting evidence explicitly; do not call an LLM to interpret state.
- Start collection with an explicitly launched `pc dashboard` service. Collection continues after browser closure until the service stops; no default startup at boot.
- Collection, aggregation, history and refresh must not invoke models, start agents, or send observations into agent conversations. Minimize additional LLM token consumption; routine monitoring requires none.
- Refresh sources independently, share results across clients, isolate source timeouts, and retain last successful observations with stale/error indicators. Defaults: local state/terminal/process evidence every 15 seconds; Git every 60 seconds; GitHub every 3 minutes; associated remote tasks every 5 minutes. Do not poll remote hosts without associated tasks or overlap collection for the same source. Back off on failure. Manual refresh remains subject to limits and does not invoke agents or `git fetch`.
- Reuse existing local GitHub authentication and SSH configuration. Do not store passwords/private keys or handle interactive login in the dashboard. Remote collection must be noninteractive and time-bounded, with actionable connection diagnostics.
- Bind to loopback and require a startup access token plus request-origin validation. Use the same protection through SSH tunnels; exclude credentials from event/access logs. No user account system.
- Organize the UI around a global overview, Fleet filtering and drill-down details. The overview highlights active work, blockers, intervention items and collection failures. Search/filtering spans registered Fleets and identifies each result's Fleet. No graph editor initially.
- The first delivery is a simple MVP: preserve observation breadth with minimal depth. Use one overview and expandable details rather than six fully developed pages. Include Fleet registration/selection/aggregation, task tables, evidence and intervention items, Git/PR/CI/remote details, bounded logs, basic search/filtering and a recent-change list.
- Exclude DAGs, historical replay, trend charts, push notifications, browser configuration editing and scheduling actions. Retain the 30-day observed-change history as a simple list.
- Use React + Vite and a Hono local service. Share only the aggregation logic actually needed by CLI and Web, respecting the existing Core/host dependency direction. Use cached polling and local file-based change records. Do not add a database service, SSE, generic plugin framework, Command Gateway, ConductorBridge or control modules.

## MVP acceptance

- One locally launched service aggregates explicitly registered Fleets for one user; multiple browser clients reuse its collected data.
- The overview and details expose the agreed data sources without changing scheduling protocols or requiring new execution identity records.
- Missing, stale, conflicting and failed observations remain visible and attributable. They do not become assertions that a task finished, a slot is free or user approval is required.
- State refresh, intervention classification and history recording do not invoke models or agents.
- Bounded logs and a retained change list support investigation; monitoring gaps and unknown execution attempts are explicit.
- Loopback access, startup token and request validation protect the read-only service without user accounts. Remote observations reuse existing noninteractive credentials.

## Next boundary

The user has requested specification preparation and publication through to-spec and confirmed the proposed test boundary. Neither specification publication nor design confirmation authorizes implementation; do not create code, install dependencies or start services as part of this work.
