# paper-craft Design Decisions

[简体中文](DESIGN.zh.md)

Technical architecture decisions for paper-craft. These choices anchor the entire system—changing them carries broad consequences.

## Modular Design

Modules follow these principles:

- **Orthogonality and low coupling**: Minimize inter-module dependencies and keep responsibilities strictly orthogonal, preventing intertwined webs of coupling even when interfaces are small, and strictly containing the blast radius of changes.
- **Deep modules and high leverage**: Expose minimal interface surface area (seams) while encapsulating complex implementation and state internally, providing high leverage for callers, ensuring locality for maintainers, and eliminating pass-through layers.
